RefGen plug-in is an Eclipse plug-in developed at [Polytechinique de Montreal](http://www.polymtl.ca) for performing automatic refactoring by [Christian Kabulo](https://github.com/Espiritous0x01) and [Rodrigo Morales](http://www.swat.polymtl.ca/rmorales/). 
It is based in "RefACO DEVELOPMENT OF A TOOL FOR AUTOMATIC CODE" by Juan María Frías Hidalgo (University of Malaga) for his MS dissertation.
It implements "RefGen" which is an automatic refactoring approach generated at Polytechnique de Montreal by Rodrigo Morales as part of its PhD Thesis.
